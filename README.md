<h3><b>Description</b></h3>

<p>This terminal based tool creates a link HTML and Javascript tmplate using Bash scripting.</p>

<h3><b>Forcus/insperation</b></h3>

<p>This was my first attempt of automating part of my code along process as I would have to often times have to make a new HTML file and JS file for each lecture</p>

<h3><b>How It Works</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Run script as "bash [/path/to/script/name.sh]</li>
  <li>You will be prompt to provide the name you want to give the files</i>
  <li>You will then be prompt to provide path</li>
  <li>Then script will then create the files of similary name:  "test.html" and "test.js"</li>
  <li>Afterwhich it will open both template files in VS Code</li>
</ul>
