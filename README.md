<h3><b>Description</b></h3>

<p>This terminal based tool creates a linked HTML and Javascript tmplate using Bash scripting.</p>

<h3><b>Forcus/Insperation</b></h3>

<p>This was my first attempt of automating part of my code along process as I would have to often times have to make a new HTML file and JS file for each lecture</p>

<h3><b>How It Works</b></h3>

<ul>
  <li>Run script in terminal as "bash [/path/to/script/name.sh]"</li>
  <li>You will be prompt to provide the name you want to give the files</i>
  <li>You will then be prompt to provide path</li>
  <li>Then script will then create the files of similary name:  "test.html" and "test.js"</li>
  <li>Afterwhich it will open both template files in VS Code</li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>This was created and implemented in a linux devices</li>
  <li>The html file is loaded with an html doc template with references to it's respective JS file</li>
  <li>Both files will have the same string before the file extensions</li>
</ul>
